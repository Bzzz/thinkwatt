Thinkwatt is a bash script for use with thinkpad laptops.
It lets you 
 * record your power consumption,
 * calculate an average of that consumption
 * and visualize that data in a 2D gnuplot graphic.

Thinkwatt only works on thinkpads laptops.
It requires the kernel module "tp_smapi" to be installed and loaded.
For the creation of a 2D graph "gnuplot" needs to be installed on the system, too.
