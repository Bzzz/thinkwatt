Thinkwatt is a bash script for use with thinkpad laptops.
It lets you 
 * record your power consumption,
 * calculate an average of that consumption
 * and visualize that data in a 2D gnuplot graphic.
 
usage:	thinkwatt [ -r <seconds> | -p | -a ] file

options:	
	-r, --record	start recording the power consumption; optional: specify output file
			once the file is recorded you'll have the option to directly create a gnuplot graph from it
	-p, --plot	create a plot image from a data file
	-a, --average	calculate the average power consumption from a data file
	-h, --help	show this help text
	
examples:
	thinkwatt -r 300 /foo/bar/consumption.dat
	thinkwatt -r 900
	
notes:
	don't use spaces in the path- and filenames as it will currently break the script
	
Thinkwatt currently *only* works on thinkpads laptops as it requires the kernel module "tp_smapi" to be installed and loaded.
For the creation of a 2D graph "gnuplot" needs to be installed on the system, too.

Update:
Thinkwatt now works with all laptops, not just Thinkpads. If you're running thinkwatt on a Thinkpad it is still recommended to use tp_smapi as a query to the control files of tp_smapi will produce more accurate results compared to using the generic acpi interface.
